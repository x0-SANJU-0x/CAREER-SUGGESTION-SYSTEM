Abhinaya has idea regarding AI-powered video games helps students to develop skills in various career in a fun mannerWill this idea be suitable for us?!

Vijesh Pethuram K, 6:44â€¯PM
I think this is not related to our topic. Because we need to only assess the skills of a student and give them career choicesÂ using AI.Â However, we'll note it.

Deepalakshmi N J S, 6:44â€¯PM
Okay!

Sanchith R S, 6:56â€¯PM
ðŸ™„what do you mean by prototype vijesh let me take care of introduction in the presentation

Deepalakshmi N J S, 6:57â€¯PM
NLP and text mining techniques to extract information from user input and identify keywords, goals, and preferences.It also processes and extracts structured data from unstructured sources like job descriptions, career guides, and industry reports.
natural language processing can be incorporated in our models? will it be suitable

Vijesh Pethuram K, 7:02â€¯PM
We are building a web app and planned to have step by step questions for the student and then analyze the choices made by them and giving them a suitable career. NLP can be useful while getting input from user. Idea noted.
Prototype is just a demo that explains what our web app will actually do.

Vijesh Pethuram K, 7:05â€¯PM
Just explain about the features of our app once we finalize all ideas

Sanchith R S, 7:06â€¯PM
it wont be  relevant to the topic grow through it once rather we can have brain teaser game to find a best matching career

Vijesh Pethuram K, 7:07â€¯PM
At initial stages we could have only text based choices later we can add games
Develop a series of questions that cover various aspects of the student's interests, skills, values, and aspirations. These questions can be in the form of multiple-choice questions.

Sanchith R S, 7:08â€¯PM
then for that we have to confirm the full layouts and modules in our application vijesh so it would be better to finalize the modules by tomorrow .

Vijesh Pethuram K, 7:09â€¯PM
Tomorrow we have presentation

1 unread, Sanchith R S (via Tasks), 7:29â€¯PM
Created a task

Deepalakshmi N J S, 7:33â€¯PM
Can we build deep learning models, to predict future career paths based on a user's past experiences, skills, and interests.This can be used by users to set a goal and Our system will mark the progress like it can organize a daily task and tell the user to complete it

Sanchith R S, 7:44â€¯PM
mm good\

Vijesh Pethuram K, 7:45â€¯PM
Yeah, we are going to use deep learning models only for our project. Also we can take experiences, skills, interest into account

Sanchith R S, 7:45â€¯PM
but daily tracking and progress in not suitable

Vijesh Pethuram K, 7:45â€¯PM
Yeah

Sanchith R S, 7:45â€¯PM
for our idea

Vijesh Pethuram K, 7:46â€¯PM
Hostel net time over. lets meet in 10:30

Sanchith R S, 7:48â€¯PM
school marks and competitions participated/won other co-curricularÂ activities are only the user's past experiences we need may be . can you state what kind of user's past experiences you are willing to @Deepalakshmi N J S

Deepalakshmi N J S, 7:59â€¯PM
It can be his area of interest.
We can get a detailed description of it
Let's train a model which analyse the description and suggest some career paths on it.

Yogarajan G., 8:02â€¯PM
Hi All, it's mainly for children at secondary level
Pls... Consider that too while preparing solution

Sanchith R S, 8:03â€¯PM

Yogarajan G., 8:03â€¯PM
Don't consider graduates for our case... Hope that's not our pbm statement

Abinaya S M, 9:19â€¯PM
how about getting real time feedback from the students about what they felt

Abinaya S M, 54 min
we can include the feedback of the persons from the different job roles example civil servants, government employees, teaching sector banking sector and so on.so the students could get some knowledge about different sectors.

Deepalakshmi N J S, 48 min


Sanchith R S, 43 min

..

Sanchith R S, 39 min
